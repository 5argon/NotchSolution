## How to add a new simulation device

- Download the [latest APK](https://github.com/5argon/NotchSolution/releases/latest) of the [Debug Scene](debug-scene.md) or build it yourself.
- Then install on your Android with file manager or `adb install -r` (r = replace). 
- After it runs, **rotate the device to both portrait and landscape** and take screenshots to remember informations. Or press the button that rotates and capture informations for you.
- See the `Editor/Devices` folder and try to imitate existing devices. These `json` files are of the same format as [Unity Device Simulator](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.device-simulator@latest/).
- Then you can submit a pull request! Thanks!
